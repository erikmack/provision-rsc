Gentoo is great!  The Rackspace Cloud is great!

But, the initial state of a new Gentoo image in the Rackspace Cloud is
crusty - there is no portage tree, and the installed package base is
quite old.  To bring it current requires several hours of
intervention.

This script automates the process.  Now I can issue:

wget http://github.com/erikmack/provision-rsc/files/provision-rsc \
	&& chmod +x provision-rsc && ./provision-rsc

... and after some emerging I'll have a current system.

Because the script is implemented as a makefile, it can be resumed if
interrupted (due to error, or user termination) without repeating
unnecessary preceding steps.

Also, it becomes easy to add targets which extend or modify the
default behavior.  

For example, one goal is to be able to set up not only a seed server
which syncs from the Gentoo repositories (the current behavior), but
also downstream servers that sync from the seed.

Or, to customize your server with specific applications, you can add
targets that test for the binary and emerge the package if the binary
isn't found.

I hope you find the script helpful.  Contact me with questions through
the Github project page.
